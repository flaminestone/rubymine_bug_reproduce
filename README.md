# Debugger Freezes and Crashes when Attempting to Modify a Variable in Watch using capybara

### Description:

When attempting to modify a variable within the watch feature of RubyMine's debugger, the application freezes and eventually crashes, particularly when using Ruby versions 3.2.0 and above. This issue does not occur with Ruby versions 3.1.4 or earlier.


_**IDE and OS version**_

- **IDE**: RubyMine 2023.3.4 Build #RM-233.14475.27 (Stable) and RubyMine 2024.1 EAP Build #RM-241.14024.10 (Early Access Preview)
- **OS**: MacOS 14.3.1 (23D60)

_**What steps will reproduce the issue?**_
1. Open the file `spec/example_spec.rb`.
2. Set a breakpoint at line 7 (containing the code `find('p')`).
3. Start debugging the file.
4. Wait for the execution to halt at the breakpoint (approximately 1 second).
5. Open the `Threads & Variables` section in RubyMine.
6. Add the code from line 7 as a watch expression (either by drag and drop or right-click).
7. Modify the added watch code to `find('p').text`.
8. Add a new watch with the same code (`find('p')`).

_**What is the expected result?**_
- Consistent behavior across different Ruby versions (3.1.4 and 3.2.0).
- The modified code reflects the changes.
- The result of executing the code is visible (e.g., "Hello world").
- The new watch expression is successfully added.

_**What happens instead?**_
When using Ruby versions 3.2.0 and above:

- Instead of the expected result, a message stating "Collecting data..." is displayed.
- Eventually, an error occurs: `Could not evaluate: find('p') Unable to read information in the specified timeout [20s]`.
- Subsequently, no variable or code in the watch menu is executed.
